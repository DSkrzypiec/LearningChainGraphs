The purpose of this project is to present algorithms for learning conditional independence structure of joint probability distributions represented by chain graphs. This is a special case of learning probabilistic graphical models which provides convenient representation of factorisation probability distribution using graphs.
Well-known and well-examined examples of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are Bayesian Networks where PGM is represented by directed acyclic graph and Markov Fields where PGM is represented by undirected graph. Chain graphs is a class of graphs that does not contains cycles (formal definition in \ref{chainGraphDef}). It contains both directed acyclic graphs and undirected graphs hence it is natural generalization of Bayesian Networks and Markov Fields.
In this paper we present one algorithm for learning chain graphs and one algorithm for learning undirected graphical models. Both algorithms are based on idea of graph decomposition which suppose to decrease complexity of algorithms.
