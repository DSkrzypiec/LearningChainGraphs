We pointed out before that LCD algorithm is composed of two phases. In the first phase
skeleton of chain graph is constructed based on provided separation tree of chain graph and 
knowledge about conditional probability distribution. Outcome of this phase is skeleton $G^{'}$ of chain
graph $G$ and set of separators $\mc{S}$. In the second phase complexes of chain graph $G$ are 
reconstructed. Algorithm in the second phase is based on outcome of the first phase. 
Mathematical grounds for both algorithms are described in subsection \ref{subsec:LCDMathBasis}.
In subsection \ref{subsec:LCDSkeletonRecovery} we describe skeleton recovery algorithm (phase 1) and
present associated example. In subsection \ref{subsec:LCDComplexRecovery} we describe complex recovery 
algorithm (phase 2) and also present associated example. In subsection \ref{subsec:LCDAlgComplex} we 
performe analysis of computitional complexity of the LCD algorithm.
