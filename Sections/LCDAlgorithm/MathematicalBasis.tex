[...] Some introduction.


\begin{thm} \label{LCDSkeletonThm} (\cite{CG}, chapter 3.1, Theorem 3) \\ 
	Let $\mc{T}(G, \mc{C})$ be a separation tree for chain graph $G$. Then vertices $u$ and $v$ are 
	c-separated by some set $S_{uv} \subset V$ in $G$ if and only if one the following conditions hold:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Vertices $u$ and $v$ are not contained together in any node $C$ of $\mc{T}(G, \mc{C})$,
		
		\item Vertices $u$ and $v$ are contained together in some node $C$, but for any separator $S$ connected
		to $C$, $\{u, v \} \not \subset S$, and there exists $S_{uv}^{'} \subset C$ such 
		that $\cSep{u}{v}{S_{uv}^{'}}{G}$,
		
		\item Vertices $u$ and $v$ are contained together in some node $C$ and both of them belong to some separator
		connected to $C$, but there is a subset $S_{uv}^{'}$ of either $\bigcup_{u \in C^{'}} C^{'}$ or
		$\bigcup_{v \in C^{'}} C^{'}$ such that $\cSep{u}{v}{S_{uv}^{'}}{G}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{prf}
	Here will be proof of the theorem.
	\QED
\end{prf}

 
\begin{prop} \label{LCDComplexProp} (\cite{CG}, chapter 3.1, Proposition 4) \\
	Let $G$ be a chain graph and $\mc{T}(G, \mc{C})$ be a separation tree of $G$. For any complex $\mc{K}$ in $G$, there
	exists some node tree $C$ of $\mc{T}(G, \mc{C})$ such that $\mc{K} \subset C$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prf} 
	Let suppose oposite. Let $\mc{K} = (u, w_1, \dots, w_n, v)$ be a complex in chain graph $G$ such that 
	for any node $C$ in separation tree $\mc{T}(G, \mc{C})$ vertex $u$ and $v$ are not contained together in $C$.
	Now let suppose that $u \in C_u$ and $v \in C_v$ where $C_u$ and $C_v$ are nodes of the separation tree.

	\end{figure}
	
	Futhermore we introduce $\rho = \{C_u, S_1, C_1, S_2, \dots, S_k, C_v \}$ as a path between $C_u$ and $C_v$ in
	the separation tree $\mc{T}(G, \mc{C})$. We observe that  $u \not \in S_1$ and $v \not \in S_1$ then we have 
	$\{ w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \} \cap S_1 \neq \emptyset$ and therefore $u \not \bigCI v \mid S_1$. The last implication 
	holds because in this case we have a head-to-head section $u \rightarrow w_1 - w_2 - \dots - w_n \leftarrow v$
	and if $\{ w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \} \cap S_1 \neq \emptyset$ then this section is not outside of $S_1$. 
	Condition $u \not \bigCI v \mid S_1 $ is contrary to definition of separation tree.
	Because of the above contrary we can assume that $u \in C_1$ and repeate the same process. After finite number
	of iteration we obtain that $u$ and $v$ have to be contained in the same node of the separation tree.
	\QED
\end{prf}
