The skeleton and complex recovery phases are independent in sense of computational complexity, hence we can
find upper bounds for those two phases separately. 
Let suppose that we have unknown chain graph 
$G = (V, E)$ with $|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$. Let further suppose that the input separation tree $\mc{T}$ contains 
tree nodes
$H = \{ C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k \}$. To denote number of elements of separation tree node $C_i$ we use $c_i$ and by
$m$ we denote count of the biggest node in a separation tree $\mc{T}$, that is 
$m = \max \{ c_i \ | \ i \in \{1, 2, \dots, k \} \}$.

The most computational expensive step in the skeleton recovery algorithm is loop in line 5 and verifying 
condition in line 6 of Algorithm \ref{skeletonRecoveryAlg}. For given node in the separation tree $C_i$ looping over
all pairs $\{u, v\} \subset C_i$ is of complexity $\frac{1}{2} c_i \cdot (c_i + 1)$ which is $\mc{O}(c_i^2)$. For given node in the separation
tree and given pair of vertex $\{u, v\}$ verifying condition in line 6 of Algorithm \ref{skeletonRecoveryAlg} is of
cost $2^{c_i}$ because it requires to look over all subsets of $C_i$. Second and third steps of the skeleton
recovery algorithm are less computational complex then the first step. Therefore complexity of the whole algorithm 
is determined by complexity of the first step which can be estimated as follow


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	T(\mc{T}) & = \mc{O} \left( \sum_{C_i \in H} \frac{1}{2} c_i (c_i + 1) 2^{c_i} \right)  \le  \\
	&  \le \mc{O} \left( \sum_{C_i \in H} \frac{1}{2}m(m+1)2^{m} \right) =  \\
	& = \mc{O} \left( km^2 2^m \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
