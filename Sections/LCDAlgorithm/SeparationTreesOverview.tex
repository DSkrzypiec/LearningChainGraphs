% ----------------------------------------------

Concept of separation trees introduced in this section is the main tool in LCD algorithm for
decompose original graph into smaller subgraphs. We will see in subsection \ref{subsec:LCDAlgComplex} that
computational complexity of LCD algorithm depends on size of largest node of input separation tree.
In subsection \ref{subsec:SepTrees} we introduce definition and example of node tree and separation tree.
In subsection \ref{subsec:SepTreesConstruct} we present method of construction separation trees.
