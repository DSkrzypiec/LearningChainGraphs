\begin{thm} \textbf{(Meek's conjecture for chain graphs)} \\
	Let $G$ and $H$ be chain graphs such that $I(H) \subset I(G)$. 
	Chain graph $G$ can be transformed into $H$ by sequence of edge additions, feasible splits and mergings such that
	after each operation in the sequence $G$ is a chain graph and $I(H) \subset I(G)$.
\end{thm}
