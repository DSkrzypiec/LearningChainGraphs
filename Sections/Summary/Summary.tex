In this project we have focused on chain graphs and structural learning algorithms. 
We have presented in details LCD algorithm and the main concept behind the algorithm - separation trees.
We described mathematical basis for this algorithm and discussed importance of lowering computational complexity
of structural learning algorithms.
We have provided efficient implementation of the algorithm which can be accessed by R package \textit{cglearn}.
